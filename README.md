# DJS

//: First collaborative development activity with me, sir Jay and sir Daniel (Team DJS).

[//]: This project features what we have learned the past week in PHP with the integration of CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap?, HTML in PHP file extensions and DATABASE namely MySQL connected in our WD49P hostinger server.

[//]: <> This is live @ http://jayfourth.wd49p.com/activity_website/

// For our future projects, we concluded that we will be integrating cookies, improve validations in static as well as in database data comparison and debug with more time by improved bug detection. 

//For concerns and suggestion, you may create a discussion in this repository.
